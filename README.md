# velcro physical modeling simulations

This is a repo that applies a few different techniques to the real-time physical modeling of the velcro (aka "hook and loop fastener") ripping sound using SuperCollider and ChuCK for audio synthesis. 


Velvet Noise
+ randomly triggered impulse train in which the sign is chosen quasi randomly to be positive or negative. Pulse density ($N_d$, number of impulses per second) is a function of the average distance between impulses $T_d$.
